            <p>
                In microbiology, the communication and comparison of research findings and
                data is often complicated by the existence of a number of different
                designation and identifiers for the same strain.
            </p>
            <p>
                StrainInfo is a service developed to provide a resolution of microbial
                strain identifiers by storing culture collection numbers, their relations,
                and deposit-associated data.
            </p>
            <p>
                StrainInfo was initially created by BCCM/LMG between the years 2005 and
                2015 and is currently being developed by DSMZ.
