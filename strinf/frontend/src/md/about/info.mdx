In microbiology, the communication and comparison of research
findings and data is often complicated by the existence of a
number of different designations and identifiers for the same strain.
StrainInfo is a service developed to provide a resolution of microbial
strain identifiers by storing culture collection numbers, their relations,
and deposition data.

StrainInfo is part of the <a target="_blank" href={N4M}>NFDI4Microbiota</a>
consortium.

StrainInfo provides users with information about strain identities.
These consist of combined strain identifiers from multiple resources.
Furthermore, the strains are linked with other comprehensive curated datasets
about this strain.
For this purpose, StrainInfo assigns a unique StrainInfo ID (SI-ID)
and a DOI to each strain and keeps an archive for different versions of
the strain data.
A user with limited information about a strain can use the StrainInfo
Strain Search to find out more about it. The Strain Search takes a wide variety
of search terms, like the StrainInfo SI-ID, culture collection numbers,
other strain designations, taxon names, and sequence accession numbers.
The search results lead the user to a StrainInfo strain page that lists
culture collection numbers and other designations of the strain, information
from and links to culture collection catalogues as well as links to other
data resources, sequence data and publications.
As a new feature StrainInfo now offers a "Strain Registration Service".
Researchers can <a href={UIApiCon.contact}>contact StrainInfo</a> to
register their own strains during the deposition procedure.
The strain will be assigned a SI-ID and a DOI. Data that is received or gathered
about this strain in the future will automatically be linked to it.
The SI-ID and DOI give the researcher unique and
persistent identifiers for their strain that can be used for publications,
deposition or identification in general.
