In microbiology, the communication and comparison of research
findings and data is often complicated by the existence of a
number of different designations and identifiers for the same strain.
StrainInfo is a service developed to provide a resolution of microbial
strain identifiers by storing culture collection numbers, their relations,
and deposition data.

StrainInfo was initially created by <a target="_blank" href={BCCM_LMG}>BCCM/LMG</a>
between the years 2005 and 2015 and is currently being developed by <a target="_blank" href={DSMZ}>DSMZ</a>.
