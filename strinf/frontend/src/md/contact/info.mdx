If you found a bug, miss a feature or wish to register strains,
please contact us!
First select the appropriate subject for the mail and click on
the **'Email Client'** button.
This will open your default email client, there you can formulate your message
and send us the mail. If possible, please try not to change the subject of the Mail,
as this will make it easier for us to assign your issue.
Of course you can also directly write to **{props.mail}** with a custom subject,
especially if your current system does not support our approach.
