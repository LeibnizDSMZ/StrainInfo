## StrainInfo UI version 2024.06.0 release <date>13 June 2024</date>

The StrainInfo database has undergone major update to improve
its functionality and user experience.

The release of **API v1.2** introduces new strain interfaces,
fully integrated with the StrainInfo website,
providing additional functionality for software integration.
Notable additions include an **autocomplete search** feature,
an aggregate search table at the strain level, and a new sequence table allowing
filtering for sequence types with direct links to ENA and NCBI databases.

The platform now offers **digital tours** for both the website and web service,
**strain statuses**, **strain history visualization**,
as well as new search capabilities for culture collections.

Enhanced **table filtering** and links to the **DSMZ Digital Diversity** Hub further
improve data accessibility.

Significant updates have also been made to the **genomic data**.
For prokaryotes, **18,263 genomes** and
**6,570 rRNA operon** sequences were added,
while eukaryotic coverage was extended by **1,007 genomes**.
Contig sequences were removed to improve data consistency.

Furthermore, **16,185 new DOIs** were registered, ensuring reliable referencing and citation of microbial datasets.

These additions collectively improve the platform's capabilities for strain
data exploration, genomic analysis, and integration into scientific workflows.
