## StrainInfo Database Article Release <date>24 September 2025</date>

The article discusses the new **StrainInfo** database, developed to address the challenges
of microbial strain identifiers across scientific literature and databases.
By consolidating and standardizing strain data from multiple sources, **StrainInfo**
improves the findability, reusability, and integration of published information related to strains.

### Key Highlights

- **Strain Identifiers**: Improves the integration and reusability of microbial strain data by addressing the issue of non-standardized or differing culture collection numbers used to describe strains.
- **Data Integration**: The database collects, standardizes, and integrates data from culture collection catalogues, sequence databases, and scientific literature.
- **Persistent Identifiers (DOI)**: The introduction of **Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)** improves the referencing and linking of microbial strain data.

**Published in**: _Database, Volume 2025_  
[DOI: 10.1093/database/baaf059](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaf059)
