Some terms, like "strain" and "deposit", may be used differently by StrainInfo than in other scientific databases and literature.

| **Term**                      | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Deposit**                   | **An instance of one strain in one culture collection with one culture collection number.**<br /><br />When a culture collection has two different culture collection numbers for a strain, they describe two different deposits. <br /><br />Different (clonal) colonies of the same strain in the same culture collection are **not** defined as two separate deposits. |
| **Culture collection number** | **Unique designation given to a strain by a culture collection.**<br /><br />We use an internal list of known culture collection prefixes and numbering schemata to recognize culture collection numbers.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Designation**               | **Every name or identifier used for a microbial strain.**<br /><br />This includes culture collection numbers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **SI-DP**                     | **Short for StrainInfo deposit.

| **SI-ID**                     | **Short for StrainInfo ID. A unique identifier for a strain described in StrainInfo.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Type strain**               | **The defining strain and nomenclatural type of a species.** <br /><br />Usually the original isolate used as a reference for the formal description of the species.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
