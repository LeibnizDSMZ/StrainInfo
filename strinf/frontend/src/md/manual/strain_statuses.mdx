A strain can have two main statuses:

1. Deposition in progress
2. Published

A strain has the status "Deposition in progress" when it is not
yet listed in any online culture collection catalogues,
but the deposition process is in progress in at least one culture collection.

When a strain is deposited in at least one culture collection
it is marked as "Published".

This status can be further divided into two levels.

1. Publicly available
2. Not publicly available

This indicates whether the published strain is currently
still listed in at least one online culture collection catalogue.
