Information about a strain from different culture collections
can be contradicting. To solve these conflicts we utilize a
voting algorithm. The voting gets applied to the following data
fields: Species name, Type Strain, Sample Source, Sample Country
Code, and BacDive ID.

This way we decide what information should be displayed at the
strain level. For transparency, the original data of each resource
is shown in the deposit details tab. Furthermore, we check the Species
Name and the Type Strain information against LPSN and/or NCBI.
