import QApiCon from '@strinf/ts/constants/api/q_api';

In Python, API requests can be made using a package called "requests".

```python
# load requests package to make API requests
import requests
```

The get method of the requests package can be used an the URL for an API call.
In this example a strain designation is stored in a variable, which is then used as
the variable in a request to the "{QApiCon.seaCulStrDes}" endpoint.
The response to the request is stored in a variable.

```python
# Example strain Prevotella bivia 653C
designation="653C"

# make API request to search deposits connected
# with the designation using the requests.get()
# method and saving the response to a
# variable called 'response'
response=requests.get("{{API_DOMAIN}}{{API_DES_SEA}}"+designation)
```

The response can be transformed to a Python object using the json decoder from the requests package.
In this case, the response is a list of SI-DPs of the deposits connected to the designation.

```python
# print 'response' using the json decoder
# from the requests package
print(response.json())
```

One of the SI-DPs can then be used to request detailed deposit information.

```python
# store the first deposit ID of the list
si_cu=response.json()[0]
print(si_dp)
# make API request to search information on the deposit with the SI-DP
response=requests.get("{{API_DOMAIN}}{{API_DEP_MAX}}"+str(si_dp))
```

All information is returned as json string, which is decoded into a Python list of nested lists and dictionaries.

```python
print(response.json())
```

Using indices and keys, specific data fields can be accessed, for example the SI-ID of the strain

```python
# store the strain ID (SI-ID) of the strain
si_id=response.json()[0]["strain"]["id"]
print(si_id)
```

or the culture collection number of the deposit and all the other designations used for the deposit.

```python
# print designation of current deposit
print(response.json()[0]["deposit"]["designation"])
# print all deposit designations of the current strain
print(response.json()[0]["strain"]["relation"]["deposit"])
# designations, except the one from the previous command
print(response.json()[0]["strain"]["relation"]["designation"])
```
