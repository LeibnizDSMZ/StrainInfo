# A central registry for microbial strains

We are developing a novel strain registration and deposition management service to
streamline the deposition process in culture collections and to make strains and
associated data easier to track by registering StrainInfo DOIs early and encouraging
consistent referencing of strains.

# Why develop a strain registry?

Increasingly, large microbiome studies generate considerable numbers of isolates.
Depositing these isolates in culture collections is not only in the interest of open
science, but is also required to formally name any new taxa found among them.
This is a challenge for both researchers and culture collections. While the former
wish to receive culture collection numbers as soon as possible to use as persistent
identifiers in publications, the latter do not have the capacity to process these sizable
collections simultaneously.

# How will StrainRegistry work?

StrainRegistry will allow microbiologists to register strains that they want to
deposit with strain meta- and deposition data, and directly submit strains for
deposition with participating culture collections. The StrainRegistry user interface
will visualize strain related data as well as the deposition status of each strain in a
private view and facilitate communication between the depositor and the responsible
culture collection curator, who will be able to view strain information, demand
further data, request shipping of biological material and change strain status.
When strains are accepted for deposition at a collection, they will receive a persistent
StrainInfo DOI and be published in the database, where they can later be linked with
culture collection numbers, sequences and publications.
This procedure is currently being developed in collaboration with the curators of the
DSMZ to simplify bulk deposition at the DSMZ and with the ambition to engage other
culture collections and standardize microbial strain deposition worldwide.

# DSMZ bulk deposition with early StrainInfo integration

While the StrainRegistry GUI is still under development, the general process of
bulk deposits with early integration in the StrainInfo database is already in place at
the DSMZ. If you are interested in depositing a set of isolates,
